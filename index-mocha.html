    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>
      I’m trying to better my writing everyday. You can start with some of my favorites,
      <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
      <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
      and <a href="http://37svn.com/3404" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.

    <h3>Speaking</h3>
    <p>My last favorite talk was one <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/mig-reyes">I gave at CreativeMornings Chicago</a>. It’s four pieces of backwards advice that captures a lot of what I’ve been thinking about how we live our lives as makers.</p>
