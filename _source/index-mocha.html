    <h3>Making</h3>
    <p>I spend most of my time making and marketing <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, the world’s most popular project management software. I like to experiment with other types of <a href="/makes">non-web work</a>, as well.</p>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>
      I’m trying to be a better writer everyday. You can start with some of my favorites,
      <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
      <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
      and <a href="http://37svn.com/3404" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.
    </p>

  <article class="believe">
    <h3>Thinking</h3>
    <p>I believe we should practice sales and writing as much as we practice design, we should nurture our community, <a href="/thinks">and a few other thoughts</a>.</p>

  <article class="speak">
    <h3>Speaking</h3>
    <p>My last favorite talk was one <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/mig-reyes">I gave at CreativeMornings Chicago</a>. It’s four pieces of backwards advice that captures what I’ve been thinking about as we live our lives as makers.</p>
