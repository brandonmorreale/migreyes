<article class="home-making">
  <h3>Making</h3>
  <p>I spend most of my time making and marketing <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, the world’s best project management software. I came over from Threadless, where I was their first fulltime interactive designer. With my roots in traditional graphic design, I like to experiment with other types of <a href="/makes">non-web and product work</a> as well.</p>

<article class="home-doing">
  <h3>Doing</h3>
  <p>I volunteer a large portion of my time to community outreach. Since 2009, I’ve been teaching design and art direction within Chicago portfolio and tech schools. I also maintain <a href="http://humblepied.com/" target="_blank">Humble Pied</a>, a video publication with the design industry’s smartest people.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p>
    I’m trying to be a better writer everyday. I like to write about design, craft, and culture. You can read some of my favorite pieces so far:
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">Try, try again</a>,
    <a href="http://37svn.com/3450" target="_blank">When culture turns to policy</a>,
    and <a href="http://37svn.com/3404" target="_blank">Reminder: Design is still about words</a>.
  </p>

<article class="home-speaking">
  <h3>Speaking</h3>
  <p>Every now and again I travel to give presentations on design. My last favorite talk was the one <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/mig-reyes">I gave at CreativeMornings Chicago</a>. It’s four pieces of backwards advice that captures what I’ve been thinking about as we live our lives as creators.</p>
