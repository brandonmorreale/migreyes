      AIGA Chicago invited 20 local designers to create a poster to celebrate the 20th Anniversary Show for Unisource. I was one of the 20 Chicago designers asked to create a poster representing Sappi. I expressed my inner child referencing my past paper plane hobby. Head to Flickr to see the other contributed poster designs.
