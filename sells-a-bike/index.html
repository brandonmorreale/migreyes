      <h2>About the bike</h2>
      <p>This is a <strong>Schwinn Road Bike</strong> with 18 gears, built to brave the weather-worn streets of Chicago. It’s been without a rider for four years. It’s time it gets a new home. If you’re about 5'10" and like going fast, this could be the perfect ride for you.</p>

      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>In the fall of 2009, I moved from the Chicago suburbs to the West Town neighborhood. Determined to ditch my car and dig into city-living, getting a brand new bike was my top priority. After doing a few months of research, my room mate and I headed to Kozy’s Cyclery to pick up what would be our very first city rides.</p>
      <p>Every day for the next year, my trusty Schwinn took me to and from the ad agency I worked at in River West. It didn’t take too long to realize my daily commutes were very short. I decided I needed more of a beater; a less-fancy workhorse. I wanted to make a switch.</p>
      <p>So began my search for my next bike, leaving the Schwinn without a rider. After <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Z5nQczHRV_/" target="_blank">finding a new one</a>, it’s time for this Schwinn to find a new home. Hopefully that’s with you.</p>
